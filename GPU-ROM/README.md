This directory is to place your patched GPU rom if you have a nvidia card

Name it `patched.rom`

## I CAN NOT PROVIDE YOU WITH A PATCHED ROM
I can't provide a patched ROM because it would require tons of disk space (and thus bandwidth) and you need a different ROM for each Nvidia card.
If you want to make a patched nvidia rom, see this guide: `https://gitlab.com/risingprismtv/single-gpu-passthrough/-/wikis/6)-Preparation-and-placing-of-the-ROM-file`
